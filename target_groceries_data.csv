It is 100% stainless steel fermented with a Stelvin screw cap closure helps to preserve the aromatic freshness and youthfulness of the wine. Pair this white wine Chardonnay with sushi, halibut, fried calamari and fish tacos for an excellent meal.

Kendall-Jackson is committed to producing only the finest quality wines from Chardonnay grape varietals grown in California. One aspect that distinguishes a Kendall-Jackson wine is vineyard sourcing.

All of the estate vineyards are certified sustainable by the CCSW (Certified California Sustainable Winegrowing) and SIP (Sustainability in Practice) programs. The proprietary approach to winemaking has earned Kendall-Jackson a world-renowned reputation for white wines that consistently exhibit signature rich layers of flavor, combined with a delicate balance.
